Social media web application clone along the lines of Signal, Facebook, and Twitter. This will include functionality of posting, commenting, user authentication, private messaging and group chat.

## Technical Goals
###### Posts, Comments, Chat, Marketplace:
Users will be able to custom tailor a ”post” to be accessible from other devices. A post will be described as image upload.
The author of the post as well as other users of the web application will be able to “comment” on existing posts. Comment defined as text.
Users can have private chat or create a Group chat with other users on the app.
Users can sell products according to the category given by admin in the marketplace side of the app and other users can buy products from the marketplace were products 
are listed by having a private chat with them.
###### User Authentication:
Users will be able to login with their specific data to access posting, commenting.
We aim to utilize JWT for authentication rather than using external libraries such as Passport.js
User's data will be stored in a database(MongoDB tentatively) to allow for recalling of existing post and profile pages.
